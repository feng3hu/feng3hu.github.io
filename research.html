			<h2>Sorting on Plan Design: Theory and Evidence from the ACA</h2>

		  		<p>Should health insurance plans be standardized? This paper explores both theoretically and empirically the implications of allowing multiple cost-sharing attributes for the functioning of health insurance markets. I develop a model of insurance choice with contracts varying in both the coverage level and the variance of uninsured losses. The model predicts that under asymmetric information, individuals with different health risks will demand plans with different designs, generating a force for plan variation even in markets that regulate the average level of coverage. I test for this type of selection on plan design in the ACA Exchange and find that a) cost-sharing variations within coverage tiers create significant differences in the risk protection to consumers and b) consumers sort differentially by health status in ways consistent with the theoretical predictions. I show that the consequences of regulating away design variation within coverage tiers depend on the extent of risk adjustment regulations and consumer confusion in the market. </p>

  			<h2>Hospital Mergers and Service Repositioning</h2>
				<p>with <a href= "https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/yu-ding/" target="_blank">Yu Ding</a>. <a href= "https://chenyuanliu.github.io/files/HospitalServiceRepositioning_DingLiu.pdf" target="_blank">[PDF]</a></p>
				<p>Horizontal mergers are often associated with product reshuffling, which may have important anti-trust consequences. This article shows that hospitals merging with local competitors reposition service lines after the merger. We use hospital-level service lists data from American Hospital Association 2002 - 2012. To avoid endogenous selection into mergers, we estimate difference-in-differences models comparing hospitals merged later to those merged earlier. We find that merging hospitals eliminate duplicate services without reducing patient volumes. Hospitals within a system become more differentiated in service positioning after the merger. However, there is limited evidence that repositioning leads to significant cost reductions.</p>

				<p>Colleges can send signals about their quality by adopting new, more alluring names. We study how this affects college choice and labor market performance of college graduates. Administrative data show name-changing colleges enroll higher-aptitude students, with larger effects for alluring-but-misleading name changes and among students with less information. A large resume audit study suggests a small premium for new college names in most jobs, and a significant penalty in lower-status jobs. We characterize student and employer beliefs using web-scraped text, surveys, and other data. Our study shows signals designed to change beliefs can have real, lasting impacts on market outcomes.</p>

			<h2>Gendered beliefs about math ability transmit across generations through children’s peers</h2>

				<p>In many societies, beliefs about differential intellectual ability by gender persist across generations. These societal beliefs can contribute to individual belief formation and thus lead to persistent gender inequality across multiple dimensions. We show evidence of intergenerational transmission of gender norms through peers and how this affects gender gaps in learning. We use nationally representative data from China and the random assignment of children to middle school classrooms to estimate the effect of being assigned a peer group with a high proportion of parents who believe boys are innately better than girls at learning math. We find this increases a child’s likelihood of holding the belief, with greater effects from peers of the same gender. It also affects the child’s demonstrated math ability, generating gains for boys and losses for girls. Our findings highlight how the informational environment in which children grow up can shape their beliefs and academic ability.</p>
