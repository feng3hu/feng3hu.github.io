			<h2>1. Insiders as Networkers: Evidence from the NSFC Rotator Program</h2>
				<p>with <a href = "http://www.alexeble.com/" target = "_blank">Alex Eble</a>.</p>
		  		<p>Effective scientific grant review process is very important for funding science, but little is known about how officers of a funding agency are involved in this procedure. This paper examines how being a temporary officer ("rotator") of the world's largest funding agency (National Natural Science Foundation of China) affects the officer's grant outcomes and career development and funding received by her home institution. We find that rotator experience has a large effect on a rotator’s chances of getting NSFC grants and being promoted to an administrative position after leaving the NSFC, but has no effect on her scientific productivity. We also find large rotator spillover effects on funding received by a rotator's home institution. We interpret the results as rotators exploiting networks formed during their tenure at the NSFC to help obtain scientific grants and thus advance their career development or benefit colleagues at their home institutions. </p>

 			<h2>2. Connections and Scientific Grants</h2>
				<p>with <a href = "https://huangweipku.com/" target = "_blank">Wei Huang</a>.</p>
		  		<p>While funding is essential for promoting science, little is known about how connections affect allocation of scientific funding resources. In this paper, we investigate how connections with a grant review committee member (“panelist”) affect researchers’ chances of getting funded by NSFC (National Natural Science Foundation of China), one of the world’s largest scientific funding agencies. Using both hand-collected and administrative data, we find that connected researchers are more likely to be awarded scientific grants and closer connections are associated with a larger likelihood of being funded. We also find that connected researchers have poorer publication quality and fewer first-authored publications than unconnected ones, despite no difference in the total number of publications. Our findings suggest that nepotism in scientific funding evaluation may lead to misallocation of research resources. </p>

			<h2>3. Does COVID-19 Persistently Affect Educational Inequality after School Reopening? Evidence from Internet Search Data in China</h2>
				<p>with Xuejing Hao.</p>
		  		<p>The literature has extensively documented how Covid-19 affects educational inequality among students. Little empirical evidence, however, is available about whether such an effect persists after school reopening, which is now possible due to large-scale vaccination campaigns in many countries. This paper attempts to explore this issue using the Internet search data from China, where schools have reopened for more than one year due to its successful efforts to contain the virus. We find that nationwide searches for learning resources surge when schools were closed, and such search behaviors remain after school reopening. We also find that high socioeconomic status (SES) households have better access to school- and parent-centered resources, as well as online tutoring resources, even after school reopening. Our findings suggest that the pandemic outbreak may have persistent effects on educational inequality. </p>

			<h2>4. Entrepreneur-Investor Gender Match and Startup Funding</h2>
				<p>with Xuejing Hao.</p>
				<p>This paper examines gender gap in startup funding using data from a Chinese reality TV show. We find that female entrepreneurs receive a smaller amount of funding from investors than males, though females have a better chance of being funded. The effects are more pronounced in sectors with a relative female advantage such as education or arts. Our text analysis of entrepreneur-investor interactions shows that female entrepreneurs are asked more questions and these questions are longer and less promotion-focused. Using the performance information on registered enterprises after the TV show, we find that returns to startup funding are larger for female entrepreneurs, suggesting that female startups are underinvested. </p>

				<p>with <a href = "http://www.alexeble.com/" target = "_blank">Alex Eble</a>. <i> Review of Economics and Statistics </i> (2022, accepted)</p>

				<p>Colleges can send signals about their quality by adopting new, more alluring names. We study how this affects college choice and labor market performance of college graduates. Administrative data show name-changing colleges enroll higher-aptitude students, with larger effects for alluring-but-misleading name changes and among students with less information. A large resume audit study suggests a small premium for new college names in most jobs, and a significant penalty in lower-status jobs. We characterize student and employer beliefs using web-scraped text, surveys, and other data. Our study shows signals designed to change beliefs can have real, lasting impacts on market outcomes.</p>

			<h2>2. Gendered beliefs about math ability transmit across generations through children’s peers</h2>

				<p>In many societies, beliefs about differential intellectual ability by gender persist across generations. These societal beliefs can contribute to individual belief formation and thus lead to persistent gender inequality across multiple dimensions. We show evidence of intergenerational transmission of gender norms through peers and how this affects gender gaps in learning. We use nationally representative data from China and the random assignment of children to middle school classrooms to estimate the effect of being assigned a peer group with a high proportion of parents who believe boys are innately better than girls at learning math. We find this increases a child’s likelihood of holding the belief, with greater effects from peers of the same gender. It also affects the child’s demonstrated math ability, generating gains for boys and losses for girls. Our findings highlight how the informational environment in which children grow up can shape their beliefs and academic ability.</p>
