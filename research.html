			<h2>Sorting on Plan Design: Theory and Evidence from the ACA</h2>

		  		<p>Should health insurance plans be standardized? This paper explores both theoretically and empirically the implications of allowing multiple cost-sharing attributes for the functioning of health insurance markets. I develop a model of insurance choice with contracts varying in both the coverage level and the variance of uninsured losses. The model predicts that under asymmetric information, individuals with different health risks will demand plans with different designs, generating a force for plan variation even in markets that regulate the average level of coverage. I test for this type of selection on plan design in the ACA Exchange and find that a) cost-sharing variations within coverage tiers create significant differences in the risk protection to consumers and b) consumers sort differentially by health status in ways consistent with the theoretical predictions. I show that the consequences of regulating away design variation within coverage tiers depend on the extent of risk adjustment regulations and consumer confusion in the market. </p>

  			<h2>Hospital Mergers and Service Repositioning</h2>
				<p>with <a href= "https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/yu-ding/" target="_blank">Yu Ding</a>. <a href= "https://chenyuanliu.github.io/files/HospitalServiceRepositioning_DingLiu.pdf" target="_blank">[PDF]</a></p>
				<p>Horizontal mergers are often associated with product reshuffling, which may have important anti-trust consequences. This article shows that hospitals merging with local competitors reposition service lines after the merger. We use hospital-level service lists data from American Hospital Association 2002 - 2012. To avoid endogenous selection into mergers, we estimate difference-in-differences models comparing hospitals merged later to those merged earlier. We find that merging hospitals eliminate duplicate services without reducing patient volumes. Hospitals within a system become more differentiated in service positioning after the merger. However, there is limited evidence that repositioning leads to significant cost reductions.</p>

				<p>Colleges can send signals about their quality by adopting new, more alluring names. We study how this affects college choice and labor market performance of college graduates. Administrative data show name-changing colleges enroll higher-aptitude students, with larger effects for alluring-but-misleading name changes and among students with less information. A large resume audit study suggests a small premium for new college names in most jobs, and a significant penalty in lower-status jobs. We characterize student and employer beliefs using web-scraped text, surveys, and other data. Our study shows signals designed to change beliefs can have real, lasting impacts on market outcomes.</p>

			<h2>2. Gendered beliefs about math ability transmit across generations through children’s peers</h2>
				<p>with <a href = "http://www.alexeble.com/" target = "_blank">Alex Eble</a>. <i> Nature Human Behaviour </i> 6: 868–879 (2022) <a href= "http://www.alexeble.com/s/Eble-Hu-NHB-2022-Gendered-beliefs.pdf" target="_blank">[PDF]</a> </p>		                
				<p>In many societies, beliefs about differential intellectual ability by gender persist across generations. These societal beliefs can contribute to individual belief formation and thus lead to persistent gender inequality across multiple dimensions. We show evidence of intergenerational transmission of gender norms through peers and how this affects gender gaps in learning. We use nationally representative data from China and the random assignment of children to middle school classrooms to estimate the effect of being assigned a peer group with a high proportion of parents who believe boys are innately better than girls at learning math. We find this increases a child’s likelihood of holding the belief, with greater effects from peers of the same gender. It also affects the child’s demonstrated math ability, generating gains for boys and losses for girls. Our findings highlight how the informational environment in which children grow up can shape their beliefs and academic ability.</p>

		                <p>This paper provides the first causal estimates of the impact of internal migrant peers on the academic performance of local students in developing countries. By exploiting the random assignment of students to classes within a school, I find that migrant peers have large and negative effects on the academic performance of local students in China and the negative spillover effects are concentrated among male students and among local students in large cities. The investigation of the underlying mechanisms suggests that the negative migrant spillover effects may come from the worsened learning environment or from the adjustment of teachers’ pedagogical practices in response to the migrant composition in the classroom.</p>

			<h2>Do Girl Peers Improve Your Academic Performance?</h2>

		                <p>I study gender peer effects on students’ academic performance in China by exploiting the random within-grade-by-school variation in the share of females in the classroom. I find a higher share of girl peers improves students’ academic performance, especially for boys.</p>

			<h2>Return to education for china’s return migrant entrepreneurs</h2>

		                <p>This paper examines the return to education for entrepreneurs in rural China with a large return migrant survey dataset. By exploiting the unique culture of male dominance in Chinese society, we use women’s education to instrument their husbands’ schooling. The results show that the return to one additional year of schooling ranges between 12.6% and 18.8% for China’s return migrant entrepreneurs, much larger than the estimated returns to education for off-farm wage workers documented in the literature. We also find that the return to education for entrepreneurs who hire paid workers more than doubles that for own-account workers.</p>

		                <p>Children routinely benefit from being assigned a teacher who shares an identity with them, such as gender or ethnicity. We study how student beliefs impact teacher-student gender match effects, and how this varies across subjects with different societal beliefs about differential ability by gender. A simple model of belief formation yields two predictions: one, that match effects will be larger for students who believe they are of low ability, and two, that they will be greater in subjects where societal beliefs tell the child they are of low ability because of their membership in a given group, such as gender or race. We test these using data from Chinese middle schools, exploiting random assignment of students to teachers. In China, many people believe boys are innately better than girls at math. We find that being assigned a female math teacher helps low-perceived-ability girls and slightly harms low-perceived-ability boys, with no effects for other children. In English and Chinese – subjects where societal beliefs do not suggest boys are superior to girls – the effects of teacher-student gender match on low perceived ability girls diminish or disappear. This yields policy implications for the assignment of teachers to students.</p>
